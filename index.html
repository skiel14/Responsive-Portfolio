      <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
      <p>I am currently a college student on leave from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA, studying computer science with a minor in applied mathematics. Aside from Rutgers' Coding Bootcamp for web development, from which this portfolio is a product, I work as a substitute teacher. I sub at schools in both Clinton and Hillsborough, New Jersey. I was inspired by my mother, a seventh grade science teacher, to start substitute teaching after working with a number of her students as a volunteer coach in preparation for their Science Olymiad competition.</p>
      <p>I currently live in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey and in my free time I love to read and participate in my local Boy Scout Venture Crew. Also, as seen in my profile picture, I enjoy traveling to new and exciting places. That picture was taken in Italy this past summer when my family and I went on vacation to Spain and Italy. Another one of my favorite things to do is group exercise classes at my gym such as Les Mills' SH'BAM dance class. I am a musician and after doing marching band at Lehigh, I love to dance to the beat and lose myself in the routine.</p>
